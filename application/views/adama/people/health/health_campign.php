This could avoid the repeated medical tests and can thereby reduce rush in clinics and labs. Easy access to the records could also speed up the distribution of benevolent funds.

This programme subsumes the existing school health programme. Child health screening and early intervention services basically refer to early detection and management of a set of 30 health conditions prevalent in children less than 18 years of age. These conditions are broadly defects at birth, diseases in children, deficiency conditions and developmental delays including disabilities - 4D's.</div>

It aims at providing continuum of care from birth to throughout childhood period. It is a step towards ‘Health for All' or ‘Universal Health Care' wherein children would get free assured services under NHM. The task is gigantic but quite possible, through the systematic approach that RBSK envisages. Implemented in right earnest, it would yield rich dividends in protecting and promoting the health of our children.</div>

This scheme is in operation in Adama from 2005-06 and is implemented with the objective of reducing maternal and infant mortality by promoting institutional delivery. The beneficiaries are pregnant women falling in the BPL category, aged 19 years and above and also SC &amp; ST categories opting deliveries in public or accredited private health institutions.</div>

                                                            <div> As the scheme targets the poor women who would generally be short of cash, it is ensured that the cash assistance provided under the scheme is made available to her in shortest possible time. Implementation of JananiSurakshaYojana has shown phenomenal progress in the last three years in the State, with number of women benefiting out of it increasing considerably over the year. This has been attributed to an increase in mass awareness and also by making the procedures simple. The State government has ordered to make all payments in one installment before discharge from the health care institutions after delivery. This facility can be availed on producing any document that proves the income status or caste in case of SC/ST.</div>

This will be further expanded to cover other conditions. Community level disability detection and management through ASHA, Anganwadi worker and Health worker will be strengthened. Remedial measures in such cases will be made available free of cost by government. Though no polio cases were reported in the state since 2000, the VPDs like diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, and tetanus are still being reported. Health Department and Social Justice Department will collaborate to achieve universal immunization and nutritional monitoring.</div>

Under the scheme, the Union government will meet 75 percent of the premium (not exceeding Rs.565), and also the cost of a Smart Card for each family, estimated at Rs.60 per card. The beneficiaries have to pay an annual registration charge of Rs.30 per family (which is part of the insurance premium to be paid to the insurance provider), and the State Government is to pay the rest of the premium, together with the administrative cost.&nbsp;</div>
